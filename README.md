Datamining Practical 2


Setting up
-----------

Using ipython with ipython notebook, scikit learn, and pandas (R in Python).

You'll need python, which all macs should have installed by default. If you don't have them, install pip (the python package manager) and virtualenv.

```bash
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install virtualenv
```

Make a virtualenv using `virtualenv dm2`. The prompt should change to begin with (dm2). Now install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
